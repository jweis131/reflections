What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository you are creating a new repository with no commits yet to the repository. To do this you need to cd into the directory you wish to create the repository and run git init. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the area between working directory and committing to your repository. The value in this is that you can have multiple files in a staging area and only submit one commit. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can add your files to the staging area and review them using git status before submitting the changes to the repository. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
