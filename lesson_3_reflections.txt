When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you remote repository has the updated version, or your need to update your local copy with the remote copy. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To ensure that you know changes have been made and they will not break what you are doing. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are cloned repository on GitHub. Clones are copies of repositories on local and github. Branches are copies of master branches of a repository for developmental purposes. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can work offline on the most up to date version of the code. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Anything other than Git and GitHub would seem to be much harder and a lot of manual work back and forth. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you are adding a feature. To ensure the feature does not break the master version.
