I have used Dropbox and Google Docs in the past and still us it today. 

Having easy access to the entire history of a file makes me a more efficient programmer in the long term by allowing me to incrementally make the program or website better by not jeopardizing the entire code base.

Having manual commits is a more practical way of version control because automatically saving the incremental steps of work will create too many versions. On the pro side it would take the manual task of committing your code out of you workflow leaving you more mind space to work on your code. 

Git version control allows for saving multiple files in one commit because it is designed control the different versions of a file that are dependent on other files even if those other files did not have anything updated to them in the current commit. 

You would use git log to see the log of commits to a repository. You would then use git dff commitID-1 commitID-2 to compare the difference between two commits using the commit id you get from git log. 

Using version control makes anyone more confident because it allows you to change the code and have the easy ability to revert back to a prior version if something should go wrong.
